# Optimizing-Browsing-Time-of-Netflix
We conducted an experiment to minimize the Netflix usersâ€™ browsing time. This browsing time is influenced in part by Tile.Size, Match.Score, Preview.Length and Preview.Type. We are interested in investigating which of these factors significantly influences the average browsing time, and figuring out the optimal value of browsing time.

## Best Result
| Tile.Size  | Match.Score | Preview.Length  | Preview.Type | MOI  | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0.2  | 82 | 70 | Teaser/Trailer | 10.52 |
